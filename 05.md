# Code Club 5

Recap 

_Expressions_ are like little questions for Racket to answer. We have seen two
ways to make expressions. An expression is either:

  1. A _value_; or
  
  2. `(` _function_ _expression_<sub>1</sub> _expression_<sub>2</sub>  ... `)`

The value of the first kind of expression is itself. To evaluate the second kind
of expression, Racket first evaluates all the sub-expressions, then applies the
function to the values produced.

We also now know several kinds of value. A _value_ is either: 

  1. A number (`42`);
  2. A string (`"Hello, World."`);
  3. A "Boolean" (either `#true` or `#false`); or
  4. An image
  
And we know several built-in functions, for example:

  1. Arithmetic functions like `+`, `-`, `log` and so on;
  2. String functions like `string-append`, `string->number` and so on;
  3. Boolean functions like `and`, `or`, and `not`; and
  4. Image functions like `circle`.

And we have seen examples of defining new functions and new "global
constants". For example:

```scheme
(define THE-ANSWER 42)
(= (* 6 7) THE-ANSWER)
```

```scheme
;; Number -> Number
;; Adds 1 to its argument
;; eg, (add1 3) should be 4
(define (add1 x)
    (+ x 1))
```

## Excerises

1. Complete this function definition by replacing the "..." with the right expression:
 
```scheme
;; Number -> Number
;; Convert a distance in inches to centimetres
;; eg, (inches->cm 1) should be 2.54
(define (inches->cm length)
    ... )
```


2. Define `feet->inches`, that converts feet into inches:

```
;;; Number -> Number
;; Convert a distance in feet to one in inches
;; eg, (feet->inches 1) should be 12
(define ... )
```

3. Design a function `feet->cm` using the functions `feet->inches` and `inches->cm`. 

4. Define a constant called `CM/INCH` whose value is 2.54 and replace 2.54 in
   the defintion of `inches->cm` with this constant.

5. Exercise with strings

```scheme
;; String -> String
;; Add "Hello, " to a given name

(check-expect (greet "James") "Hello, James")
(check-expect (greet "Tomás") "Hello, Tomás")

(define (greet name)
 ...)
```

6. Go back to the conversion functions and replace the examples in comments with
   `check-expect`.

7.
```scheme
;; Number Number -> String
;; Convert a distance in feet and inches to centimetres

(check-expect (feet/inches->cm 5 7) 170.18)

(define (feet/inches->cm ft in)
    ... )

```


7.

```scheme

;; Number -> Image
;; Draw a tree of the given height

(define (tree height) 
```
