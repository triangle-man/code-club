# Code Club 7

Recap 

_Expressions_ are like little questions for Racket to answer. We have seen two
ways to make expressions. An expression is either:

  1. A _value_; or
  
  2. `(` _function_ _expression_<sub>1</sub> _expression_<sub>2</sub>  ... `)`

The value of the first kind of expression is itself. To evaluate the second kind
of expression, Racket first evaluates all the sub-expressions, then applies the
function to the values produced.

We also now know several kinds of value. A _value_ is either: 

  1. A number (`42`);
  2. A string (`"Hello, World."`);
  3. A "Boolean" (either `#true` or `#false`); or
  4. An image
  
And we know several built-in functions, for example:

  1. Arithmetic functions like `+`, `-`, `log` and so on;
  2. String functions like `string-append`, `string->number` and so on;
  3. Boolean functions like `and`, `or`, and `not`; and
  4. Image functions like `circle`.

And we have seen examples of defining new functions and new "global
constants". For example:

```scheme
(define THE-ANSWER 42)
(= (* 6 7) THE-ANSWER)
```

```scheme
;; Number -> Number
;; Adds 2 to its argument
(check-expect (add2 3) 5)

(define (add2 x)
    (+ x 2))
```


# Choices

To make a yes/no choice, use `if`:
```scheme
(if <test-expression> <then-expression> <else-expression)
```
If the value of `<test-expression>` is `#true` then the result of the whole expression is
the value of `<then-expression>`, otherwise the result is the value of `<else-expression>`.

For example:
```scheme
(if (string=? my-name "Bob") "Your name is Bob" "Your name is not Bob")
```


## More ways of making decisions

To make a choice of one amongs many alternatives, use `cond`:
```scheme
(cond [<question-expression> <answer-expression>]
      ...
      [else <else-expression>])
```
Finds the first `<question-expression>` that evaluates to `#true` and returns
the value of the corresponding `<answer-expression>`. If none of the questions is
true, returns the value of `<else-expression>`. 

The `else` clause may be omitted, in which case it's an error if none of the
`<question-expression>`s are true.

# Nano-project

Let's turn numbers into English. 

For example,
```scheme
(number->english 37)
```
should produce the string `"thirty-seven"`.

1. Write a function `number-0-to-19->english` which takes a number less than 20
   and produces a string representing that number in english.
   
   ```scheme
   (define (number-0-to-19->english N)
       STUFF GOES HERE)
   ```

2. Write `number-0-to-99->english` that calls `number-0-to-19->english` on any
   number less than 20, and otherwise prints `"lots"`.
   
3. What is the rule for numbers between 20 and 99? 

4. The function `quotient` divides one whole number by another; the function
   `remainder` gives the remainder when one whole number is divided by another. For
   example,
   
```scheme
(quotient 56 10)
```
is `5`, and
```scheme
(remainder 56 10)
```
is `6`. 


   Can you write `number-20-to-99->english` using `quotient` and `reminder` (and
   possibly `number-0-to-19` and possibly a helper function)?
