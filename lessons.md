Perhaps surprisingly, there was no confusion at all about prefix notation for
arithmetic expressions.

I suspect there's going to be a lot of confusion about the parentheses and the
difference between, for example, `12` and `(12)`. 

## 02

Extending values to strings, booleans, and images.

It's going to be hard to choose good examples: People have very different domain
knowledge, and the domain challenge can get in the way of learning programming.

It's going to be hard for individuals to attend every class. For people who have
a full-time job, this will always be a lower priority than something else -- and
there is always something else.

Ideas:

 - We could drop to one (lunchtime) per week. This seems too little to maintain
   momentum, but perhaps we will end up here eventually, and perhaps that's okay
   if there are projects
   
 - We could change from formal + informal, to each class being the same, a
   mixture of new material and practice, but where we cover the new material in
   both, possibly staggered. (Eg, in class 1 we do A, in class 2 A + B, in class
   3 B + C, in class 4 C + D, and so on.)
   
On reflection, I think the major difficulty will be "breaking down"
problems. Given a task, there is the whole "how do I even get started" problem?

When should I introduce testing? Maybe as soon as definitions are introduced?

## 03 (4)

Down to four this week. Not entirely sure how to manage the trade-off between:
losing people because we're going too fast, and losing people because we're not
doing interesring things. 

It turned out that digressing into Excel was very helpful -- not only is it
relevant to many people, but also it helps people understand what Racket is
doing.
