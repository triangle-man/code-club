# Code Club 6

Recap 

_Expressions_ are like little questions for Racket to answer. We have seen two
ways to make expressions. An expression is either:

  1. A _value_; or
  
  2. `(` _function_ _expression_<sub>1</sub> _expression_<sub>2</sub>  ... `)`

The value of the first kind of expression is itself. To evaluate the second kind
of expression, Racket first evaluates all the sub-expressions, then applies the
function to the values produced.

We also now know several kinds of value. A _value_ is either: 

  1. A number (`42`);
  2. A string (`"Hello, World."`);
  3. A "Boolean" (either `#true` or `#false`); or
  4. An image
  
And we know several built-in functions, for example:

  1. Arithmetic functions like `+`, `-`, `log` and so on;
  2. String functions like `string-append`, `string->number` and so on;
  3. Boolean functions like `and`, `or`, and `not`; and
  4. Image functions like `circle`.

And we have seen examples of defining new functions and new "global
constants". For example:

```scheme
(define THE-ANSWER 42)
(= (* 6 7) THE-ANSWER)
```

```scheme
;; Number -> Number
;; Adds 2 to its argument
(check-expect (add2 3) 5)

(define (add1 x)
    (+ x 1))
```

## What's missing?

1. Making decisions
2. Doing things over and over again


## Exercises

1. Use `place-image` and `empty-scene` to write a function that places a circle
   in a blank scene of size 200 x 160 at a position halfway up and at a given
   distance from the left side.

Don't forget 
```scheme
(require 2htdp/image)
```

Here's the template for you (I'll explain later why it's called `moving-ball` :

```scheme
;; number -> image
;; Place a circle at a specified location in an empty scene
(check-expect (moving-ball 80) 
              (place-image 
               (circle 10 "solid" "red") 
               80 80
               (empty-scene 200 160))) 

(define (moving-ball x) 
 ... )
```

2. Replace magic numbers with constants

For example,

```scheme
(define BALL-RADIUS 40)
```

3. Make the ball move from left to right using `animate`.


## Decisions

```scheme
(if (> 3 2) 3 2)
```
or
```scheme
(cond
    [(> 3 2) "three is bigger than two!"]
    [(< 3 2) "two is bigger than three!"]
    [else "three is the same size as two!"])
```

4. Write a function `biggest` which, given two numbers, returns the larger of
   the two, eg `(biggest 3 2)` should produce 2. 
   
   (This function already exists is `max`.)
